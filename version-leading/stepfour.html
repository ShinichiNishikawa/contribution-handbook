  		<p>This pack is designed to work in partnership with the reviewer contribution pack. As a result, there is a format we'd recommend and the packs walkthrough. It goes like this (the structure follows the reviewer pack steps):
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure the room has drinks and snacks. If you are going to have a room it's great to ensure that has water and snacks for your contributor. They are going to be working hard so lets reward them!</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
